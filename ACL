ACLs are:

  acl subject object attributes access;

subject and object are LDAP search filter expressions.
attributes is a comma separates list of attributes.
access says what accesses are allowed or disallowed in a chmod-like
syntax.

As an abbreviation, you can use '*' to mean '(objectClass=*)' for
subject or object, and you can use '*' to mean 'all attributes' in
attributes.

Example:

  acl (dn=cn=root,o=fefe,c=de) (objectClass=*) * +rwdR



ACLs can have some redundancy in them, so we want to find filter strings
in ACLs that are the same, and then only evaluate them once.  So we need
to write the ACLs to disk like this:

  uint32 filters;
  uint32 offsets_to_filters_in_scan_ldapsearchfilter_format[filters];
