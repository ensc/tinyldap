Please read ldap.h and asn1.h for an overview of the API.

Example code using the high level API is in tinyldap and ldapclient.
This will be encapsulated some more eventually.

ldapclient is the client test application.  It connects to localhost,
makes a BindRequest and dumps the BindResponse in human readable form.

tinyldap is the server test application.  It can understand BindRequest,
some simple forms of SearchRequest, and it can even answer simple
queries.

tinyldap now supports an external database representation with indexes.
However, the indexes are not used yet by tinyldap.  It still iterates
through all records.  Use "parse" to create the file "data" from an LDIF
file called "exp.ldif" (I can't give you my test data, sorry).  Then use
"addindex" to add indexes if you like.  Use "dumpidx" to have the
contents of data displayed on screen.  tinyldap has been modified to use
data instead of the in-memory linked list.

Do _not_ add an index for objectClass!  It will not work!
