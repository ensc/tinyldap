Please read ldap.h and asn1.h for an overview of the API.

Example code using the high level API is in tinyldap and ldapclient.
This will be encapsulated some more eventually.

ldapclient is the client test application.  It connects to localhost,
makes a BindRequest and dumps the BindResponse in human readable form.

tinyldap is the server test application.  It can understand BindRequest,
some simple forms of SearchRequest, and it can even answer simple
queries.
