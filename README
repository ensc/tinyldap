Please read ldap.h and asn1.h for an overview of the API.

Example code using the high level API is in tinyldap and ldapclient.
This will be encapsulated some more eventually.

ldapclient is the client test application.  It connects to localhost,
makes a BindRequest and dumps the BindResponse in human readable form.

tinyldap is the server test application.  It can understand BindRequest,
some simple forms of SearchRequest, and it can even answer simple
queries.

tinyldap now supports an external database representation with indexes.
Use "parse" to create the file "data" from an LDIF file called
"exp.ldif" (I can't give you my test data, sorry).  Then use "addindex"
to add indexes if you like.  To make an index case insentive (and the
corresponding attribute, too), give a third argument to addindex (e.g.
"./addindex data sn i"; in case I extend this later, stick with "i").
Use "dumpidx" to have the contents of data displayed on screen.
tinyldap has been modified to use data instead of the in-memory linked
list.

Do _not_ add an index for objectClass!  It will not work!

parse will now normalize dn before writing it to the index.  That means
that the attribute names in dn are lowercased, ';' is converted to ','
and spaces after ';' or ',' are removed.
