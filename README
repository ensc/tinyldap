Please read ldap.h and asn1.h for an overview of the API.

Example code using the high level API is in tinyldap and ldapclient.
This will be encapsulated some more eventually.  The next steps are:

  - integrate the LDIF parser from t1.c
  - write fmt_ldapsearchresponse
  - write fmt_ldapsearchrequest and scan_ldapsearchresponse

Then we will have a minimal LDAP server!

ldapclient is the client test application.  It connects to localhost,
makes a BindRequest and dumps the BindResponse in human readable form.

tinyldap is the server test application.  It reads LDAPMessages from
stdin, looks whether it is a BindRequest and if so, answers it with an
affirmative BindResponse.  If it is a SearchRequest, it will be parsed
and dumped to stdout in human readable form.  That will obviously change
next.
